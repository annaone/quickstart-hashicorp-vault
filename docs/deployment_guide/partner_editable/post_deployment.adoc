=== Review audit logs 

This Quick Start is configured to ship {partner-product-short-name} audit logs to Amazon CloudWatch. To see your logs, open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/[Amazon CloudWatch console]. In the navigation pane, choose *Logs*, and then select *{partner-product-short-name}-Audit-Logs-XXXX* value from the *Outputs*. You will see a screen that is similar to <<auditlogs>>.

=== Test the deployment

To access the {partner-product-short-name} server cluster environment, access the Application Load Balancer (ALB) endpoint that was created during the deployment.

[start=1]
. Locate the AWS Secrets Manager secret from the *Outputs* tab containing the {partner-product-short-name} root token and recovery secrets for {partner-product-short-name}.

[#output2]

[start=3]
. Use your preferred web browser to open the URL. On the Vault server login screen, use the root token from AWS Secrets Manager to log in to the Vault server cluster.
